# Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree

## Overview

The goal of the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program is to equip learners with the unique skills they need to build database-backed APIs and web applications. Each project is an opportunity to apply the lessons learned and demonstrate skills to potential employers.


### Here, you can find starter-code the following projects:

- 01_fyyur/starter_code - This is the project from C1. SQL and Data Modeling for the Web
- 02_trivia_api/starter - This is the project from C2. API Development and Documentation
- 03_coffee_shop_full_stack/starter_code - This is the project from C3. Identity and Access Management
- 04_deploying_flask_app_to_kubernetes_using_eks/starter - This is the project from C4. Server Deployment & Containerization
- capstone - This is the final project of this Nanodegree.


## Learning Objectives

- Design and build a database for a software application.
- Create and deploy a database-backed web API (Application Programming Interface).
- Secure and manage user authentication and access control for an application backend.
- Deploy a Flask-based web application to the cloud using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Program Information

- **Estimated Time:** 4 months at 5-10hrs/week*
- **Prerequisites:**
  - Write and test software with Python or another object-oriented programming language.
  - Query a SQL database using SELECT.
  - Write to a SQL database using INSERT.

### Required Hardware/Software

- **Requirements:**
  - Write software for front-end applications and websites using JavaScript.
  - Fetch and display data from an API using AJAX or Fetch.
  - Organize data using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
  - Computer with a broadband internet connection.

This program uses:
- Python 3.7
- PostgreSQL 11
- SQLAlchemy
- Flask 1.0
- Docker
- Various Python packages

## Courses and Projects

### Course 1: SQL & Data Modeling for the Web

Master relational databases with the power of SQL, and leverage Python to incorporate database logic into programs.

**Course Project: Design a Venue Booking Database**

- Build out the data models and database for an artist/venue booking application.
- Use SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL to build out the data models.
- Write both raw SQL and SQLAlchemy commands to power the backend functionality of the website.

**Skills Learned:**
- Connecting & Interacting with Databases
- Intro to SQLAlchemy & SQLAlchemy ORM Basics
- SQLAlchemy ORM in Depth
- Building a CRUD App with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Migrations

### Course 2: API Development and Documentation

Learn how to use APIs to control and manage web applications, including best practices for API testing and documentation.

**Course Project: Trivia API**

- Build a Trivia API that allows users to search for trivia questions and answers, add new questions, and modify the difficulty rating of questions.
- Use APIs to control and manage a web application using existing data models.

**Skills Learned:**
- Introduction to APIs
- HTTP & Flask Basics
- Endpoints and Payloads
- API Testing
- API Documentation

### Course 3: Identity Access Management

Implement authentication and authorization in Flask and understand how to design against key security principles.

**Course Project: Identity Access Management**

- Build the backend for a coffee shop application.
- Add user accounts and authentication using role-based access management strategies.
- Secure the application using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and role-based control design patterns.

**Skills Learned:**
- Foundations of Security
- Authentication
- Password Security
- Authorization
- Thinking Adversarially

### Course 4: Server Deployment & Containerization

Develop an understanding of containerized environments, use Docker to share and store containers, and deploy a Docker container to AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service using a CI/CD pipeline.

**Course Project: Deploy a Flask App to Kubernetes Using EKS**

- Create a container for a Flask web app using Docker.
- Deploy the container to a Kubernetes cluster using Amazon EKS.
- Use automated testing to prevent bad code from being deployed and monitor the appâ€™s performance using AWS tools.

**Skills Learned:**
- Containers
- AWS & Kubernetes
- Deployment Using CI/CD

### Capstone Project

Combine all the skills learned in this course to construct a database-backed web API with user access control. Choose an app to build, design and build out all of the API endpoints needed, and secure them for use in any front-end application (web or mobile).
